Two inputs: number of bins and filename that contains the floating point numbers
-> Command line with mpiexec will specify the number of process.

mpiexec -n x ./histogram b filename

Where:
b: is the number of bins, 0 < b <= 50
x: number of processes, 0 < t <= 50
filename: the name of the text file that contains the floating point numbers

You program must print on screen, the bins and their counts, as shown in the example above.
